Can you tell me the duration of your fever? Has it been constant or has it changed over time?\n2. Are there any gastrointestinal symptoms you're experiencing, such as abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or vomiting?\n\nThese details will help me narrow down the possible causes and provide more accurate guidance.\n\nAlso, I want to reiterate that if you're concerned about your symptoms or if they persist, it's essential to consult a qualified healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment."

Could you please clarify what you mean by that? Is it possible that you meant to say that you have a low-grade fever or a mild fever?\n\nAlso, regarding your concern about malaria, I want to remind you that if you live in or come from an endemic area and present with fever, malaria should always be considered as part of the differential diagnosis. However, only a qualified healthcare professional can provide a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nLet's focus on gathering more information to help us better understand your symptoms and determine the best course of action for you."
