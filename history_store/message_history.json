The duration of your fever?\n2. Any gastrointestinal symptoms you're experiencing (abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting)?\n3. Have you noticed any rash or skin lesions on your body?\n4. Have you traveled to any areas with a higher risk of these diseases in the past few weeks?\n\nYour answers will help me narrow down the possible causes and provide a more accurate diagnosis."
